As the Co-Founder of AashaEd along with my partner Priyanshu Singh, under the guidance of Ms. Deepa Sharma, HOD- Computer Science at Seth Anandram Jaipuria School, we created several GUI based applications which would be able to help people with motor disabilities, learning disabilities and other impairments to be able to learn and communicate to be finally be able to lead a life of opportunities. Our most prominent application was the 'AashaEd Learning Software' which allowed people with learning disabilities and primary-class students to learn to read, spell, pronounce, comprehend and pick-up the use of English words through the usage in a sentence with our software. It was fabricated in the form of a game, comprising of points and difficulty levels. It also allowed the user to track their progress through graphs. It was also tested with people having learning disabilities in our institution, and their review was very affirmative. We have showcased and applied our application in various tech events ever since.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Having been introduced to computers and technology at an early age, I've always been fascinated by the thought of creating something new and solving real-world problems, which lead me to chose my career as an engineer. I am currently a sophomore at the prestigious Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.<br><br>  I have a keen interest in programming, specifically in Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have been coding for the past five years and have gained valuable experience by participating and conducting various coding competitions, being the Programming Head of Cyber Crew, the tech club of my alma mater, Seth Anandram Jaipuria School.<br><br>
                It had always been my ambition to help the underpriviliged and the differently challenged of the society. Hence, when I was 17, I co-founded AashaEd, a platform that creates innovative applications for individuals with learning disabilities.<br><br>
                I have a strong inclination towards applied physics, coding, and sharing my knowledge with others. I specialize in communication, management, and learning about new technologies. I also aim at initiating a YouTube channel to provide free education in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics to high school students.</p>
